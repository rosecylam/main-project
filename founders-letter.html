			<p>I founded <em>FIRST</em> in 1989 to inspire and recognize science and technology in young people. In fact, we were one of the first organizations to do it—setting in motion a movement to transform our culture to one where science, technology, engineering, and invention are celebrated, and young people dream of becoming leaders in these fields as much as they do in athletics and entertainment.</p>

			<p>We began with 28 robotics teams competing in a U.S. high school gym, and we’ve come a long way since then. In 2019, we celebrated our 30th anniversary. From just one season event in our inaugural competition year, this year we held 3,600 official <em>FIRST</em> events for four <em>FIRST</em> programs in over 100 countries—that’s more than half the world’s countries—and we capped it off with two international <em>FIRST</em> Championship events attended by more than 75,000 people.</p>

			<p>By fueling curiosity and fostering community, <em>FIRST</em> builds tomorrow’s challenge facers, risk takers, and change makers—what every young person can become, if supported. As our past 30 years have shown, leaders in education, industry, and community must work together to develop the future workforce and ensure it’s one where everyone can succeed.</p>

			<p>As our world grows more complex, having a meaningful understanding of science and technology is more important than ever for next generations to effect change. Among other incredible findings from our unrivaled longitudinal impact study, <em>FIRST</em> participants are twice as likely as their peers to show gains in STEM knowledge. Even more critical are the inspiration and community that drive their desire to learn and move us forward. With 70% of <em>FIRST</em> alumni declaring engineering and computer science majors by their second year of college, we’re quickly getting there.</p>

			<div class="highlight">Kids learn better and grow stronger when they’re surrounded and supported by people who understand where they come from and who can see their potential—people like you. As an organization, <em>FIRST</em> learns and grows stronger when it is supported by you, too.</div>

			<p>With your support, we’re focused on expanding participation; improving equity, diversity, and inclusion in our programs; scaling our programs efficiently; ensuring sustainability; and achieving broad recognition. These strategic objectives have driven our actions these past few years, and they will continue to be our guiding pillars going forward. It’s thanks to the full <em>FIRST</em> community that <em>FIRST</em> participants have the confidence and strength to move past their toughest challenges and forge their way into the future. <em>FIRST</em> is uniquely positioned to reach deep into neighborhoods around the world to help young people overcome obstacles standing in their way and give them a place to belong—and yet there are still so many neighborhoods without access to <em>FIRST</em>. We must continue expanding our reach until youth robotics is as ubiquitous and accessible as youth soccer.</p>

			<p>As we move into the next decade of <em>FIRST</em>, let’s build a better future—together.</p>
